#  Express JS -->
TODO:
Express is a user-friendly framework that simplifies the development process of Node applications. It uses JavaScript as a programming language and provides an efficient way to build web applications and APIs. With Express, you can easily handle routes, requests, and responses, which makes the process of creating robust and scalable applications much easier.

Moreover, it is a lightweight and flexible framework that is easy to learn and comes loaded with middleware options. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Express is a great choice for building your application.

Express Key Features
Middleware and Routing: Express.js makes it easy to organize your application’s functionality using middleware and routing. Middleware functions allow you to handle tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling. Routing ensures that incoming requests are directed to the appropriate handlers.
Minimalistic Design: Express.js follows a simple and minimalistic design philosophy. This simplicity allows you to quickly set up a server, define routes, and handle HTTP requests efficiently. It’s an excellent choice for building web applications without unnecessary complexity.
Flexibility and Customization: Express.js doesn’t impose a strict application architecture. You can structure your code according to your preferences. Whether you’re building a RESTful API or a full-fledged web app, Express.js adapts to your needs.
Scalability: Designed to be lightweight and scalable, Express.js handles a large number of requests asynchronously. Its event-driven architecture ensures responsiveness even under heavy loads.
Active Community Support: With a thriving community, Express.js receives regular updates and improvements. You’ll find ample documentation, tutorials, and plugins to enhance your development experience.





# How to create a server in Nodejs -->
TODO:

HTTP modules ->
Hypertext Transport Protocol modules of Nodejs
HTTP modules is the core modules of NodeJs
HTTP modules provide way to create server and handle HTTP request and response.
It exposes various classes, Functions and providies to work with HTTP 
To use the HTTP server and Client one most require('node:http')

# Features of HTTP method
Create an HTTP server using 'http.createServer()'
Listen to incoming request using the 'server.listen()' method 
Handle incoming request and send response using the 'request' and 'response' object passed object using 'response.write()'
End the response using 'response.end()'.
Send and HTTP request to a server using 'http.request()'
Receive a response from a server using the 'response' event 
'http.clientRequest'  object returned by 'http.request()'

# What are frameworks
A frameworks is a software tool or platform that provides developers with a set of pre-written code, components, and libraries that they can use to build applications.
Frameworks often include a set of guidelines and best practices that help developers to write code more efficiently and to build applications that are more stable, secure, and scalable.
Some popular web development framework include Ruby on Rails, Django, Laraval, React, Angular, And Vue.js.
