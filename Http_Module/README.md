HTTP Module - >

To make HTTP requests in Node.js, there is a built-in module HTTP in Node.js to transfer data over the HTTP. To use the HTTP server in the node, we need to require the HTTP module. The HTTP module creates an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.

const http = require('http');
